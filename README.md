# School_District_Analysis
## **Overview**
Analyze data on student funding and standardized test scores to provide insight on performance trends and patterns.  This analysis will help in making strategic decisions regarding future funding for the district.
## **Results of Analysis**
* Based on analysis of the district summary, taking out the 9th graders from Thomas High School made only a negligible difference.

* While there were marked differences with 9th grade removed, it did not affect Thomas’ overall performance and they remained in the top 5 performing schools.
  Taking out the 9th grade scores did affect the averages by grade but not necessarily for the school overall.

* Changes to scores by school spending were negligible as were by school size and type.

## **Summary**
While the overall changes appeared to be negligible, the analysis did show:
1.	Small changes in overall scores by spending, size, and type. 
2.	Removing the offending 9th grade scores did not change the fact that charter schools are outperforming district schools.
3.	Removing the offending 9th grade scores did show a marked difference when reviewing overall percentages for 9th grade itself. 
4.	Removing the offending 9th grade scores did show a marked difference in passing percentages for Thomas High School.
